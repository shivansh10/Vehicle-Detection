# Vehicle-Detection

Vehicle detection and tracking module that will detect and track the vehicles in a given video.

There are two ways in which I have implemented:

1. Vehicle Detection using YOLOv4.
2. Vehicle Detection using OpenCV.

Video used in code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM0hX7nomi8

Output of first method i.e. through YOLOv4 and Darknet: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-1p0g_Z0uarBs6hnY2h8KstXd1eUkQmG/view?usp=sharing
Output of second method i.e. though OpenCv: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wixMaNeS8BPzUls_VZlHNSuz1VUBFBwy/view?usp=sharing
